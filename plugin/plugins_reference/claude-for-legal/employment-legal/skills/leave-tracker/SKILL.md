# /leave-tracker

Checks all open leaves with hard legal deadlines and surfaces only the ones
requiring a decision or action. Not a status board — tells you what you need
to do and why.

## Instructions

1. Load the `leave-tracker` agent and run the full workflow.

2. If no HRIS is connected and no `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/employment-legal/leave-register.yaml` exists, prompt
   the attorney to upload a leave spreadsheet or use
   `/employment-legal:log-leave` to add entries.

3. Alerts only for leaves requiring action. Clean leaves summarized one line each.

## Examples

```
/employment-legal:leave-tracker
```

Run this weekly — set a Monday-morning reminder to invoke
`/employment-legal:leave-tracker`. Automated scheduling requires a separate
integration (calendar reminder, cron job, etc.); Claude Code agents do not
self-schedule.
