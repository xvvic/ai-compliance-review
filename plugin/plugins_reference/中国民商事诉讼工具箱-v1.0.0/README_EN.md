> **Legal Verification** guards the "exit" (verifies all legal citations line-by-line before any formal document is delivered). Uploaded files are automatically parsed into Markdown before entering analysis workflows (no separate trigger needed).

## Workflow Connections

```
Document Parsing ── Upload files (PDF/images/Word/PPT) auto-parsed to Markdown before analysis/drafting (user-configurable parsing backend, built-in pypdf/Read fallback)

Fact Analysis ──produces──→ Main fact document (md) ⇒ links: Relationship Chart (HTML) + Timeline (HTML) + embedded chronicle
     │
     ↓
Element Attack/Defense Analysis ──depends on──→ Fact Analysis
     │
     ↓
┌────┼────┬────────┐
│    │    │        │
Complaint  Defense Brief  Evidence Catalog  Cross-Examination

└────┬────┘
     ↓
  Trial Outline (with examination question list)
     │
     ↓ (pre/post-trial)
Closing Argument (pre-trial brief + post-trial supplemental brief, covers first/second/retrial)

Procedural Documents ── Eight-family router (preservation/evidence/party & claim changes/trial procedure/enforcement/filing/other/jurisdiction objection), includes jurisdiction objection
Property Investigation ── Independent (can connect to Procedural Documents' preservation/online asset control)
Legal Research Report ── Independent (research conclusions can feed into Element A/D / Complaint / Defense Brief)
New Law Interpretation ── Independent (old-vs-new comparison-driven firm-level regulatory interpretation, can connect to Legal Research Report / Element A/D)

Legal Verification ── Quality fence: any skill that produces formal documents must pass Legal Verification for line-by-line statute/article/case citation verification before delivering md output (and subsequent Word conversion); only passes after all citations verified accurate

— Case Management Section (spans entire case lifecycle, attorney/counsel dual-mode, COLLAB.* platform + qmind) —
Case Manager ──intake (attorney: conflict-check gate / counsel: external-counsel evaluation)──→ Deadline computation (compute initial deadlines · create four-tier todo · optional scheduled reminders)
                 │
Receive judgment/close ──→ Case Review (trial review / judgment analysis / closing review)──→ Case Manager (close + archive)
                                                              │
                                                              ↓
Litigation Knowledge Base ──deposit──→ Legal Research Report / New Law Interpretation / Case Review outputs deposited into qmind/DingTalk Docs (retrievable for future cases)
```

## Installation

Place this directory in a location accessible by QoderWork, then install the plugin in QoderWork:

```
Settings → Plugin Management → Install Local Plugin → Select this directory
```

Or copy the directory to `~/.qoderwork/plugins-custom/qoder-for-cn-litigation/`.

---

## First Use

After installation, it's recommended to run `/onboarding-interview` to complete your practice profile configuration. The suite will personalize all subsequent skills based on your role (counsel/attorney), stance preference (plaintiff/defendant), risk calibration, and other settings.

If you skip the onboarding, all skills still function normally, but without personalized recommendations.

## MCP Dependencies (Optional Enhancement · Platform-Agnostic · Multi-Vendor Failover)

All MCP dependencies in this plugin are **optional** — you can produce complete drafts without connecting any MCP. The four backend categories (legal research / business information / document parsing / collaboration platform) are all **platform-agnostic**: each skill invokes only by capability slot (`LAW.*`/`BIZ.*`/`PARSE.*`/`COLLAB.*`), probes connected MCPs at runtime via `qw_mcp_list`, and **auto-failovers** when multiple vendors of the same type are configured. See `qoder.md` "External Capability Backends" and `connectors.md` for capability-to-vendor mappings. Enhanced capabilities after connection:

| Capability Backend | Capability Slot | Available Vendors (Swappable/Failover) | Fallback When Missing |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Legal Research | `LAW.*` (statute/regulation/case search · detail · semantic · citation verification) | Yuandian / PKULaw (use one or both for failover) | Annotate `[L4-Statute-Unverified]` |
| Business Information | `BIZ.*` (entity verification · equity · investment · risk · IPR · associations) | Qichacha / Tianyancha / Qixin etc. (auto-adapts by actual function) | WebSearch fallback, annotate `[L4-Entity-Info-Unverified]` |
| Visualization | — | None (built-in HTML/SVG output, zero external dependencies) | — |
| Web Search (SEARCH.*) | `SEARCH.web_search` / `SEARCH.ai_search` | Runtime detection (GoogleWebSearch / IflowWebSearch / IflowAiSearch / Tavily etc.) | WebFetch fallback |
| Document Parsing | `PARSE.to_markdown` | User-selected backend (MinerU / Alibaba Cloud Bailian / markdownify / self-hosted alternatives, multi-backend + failover) | See fallback chain below |
| Collaboration Platform | `COLLAB.*` (sheets/documents/contacts/calendar/email) | DingTalk (via dws) / Feishu (via lark-cli) / similar OA; choose one | Local JSON+Markdown fallback |

**Configuration**: Enable the corresponding MCP service in QoderWork's "Connectors" settings — no plugin file modifications needed. The suite auto-detects connected backends at runtime; multiple vendors of the same type auto-failover.

### Quality Fence · Output Gate

| Skill | Description |
|------|------|
| `/legal-verification` | **Mandatory gate before every file output**: verifies all statute/article/case citations line-by-line via LAW.* backend (Yuandian/PKULaw swappable + failover), determines "accurate / timeliness risk / semantic inconsistency / not found", passes only after all verified; can also independently verify any text |

## Design Principles

1. **Lightweight Skeleton**: Provides methodological core and document capability framework without over-prescribing, leaving room for user growth
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Every MCP dependency has a fallback path; complete drafts can be produced without any MCP
3. **User-Configurable**: Personalized via onboarding interview + qoder.md; subsequent quick changes via `/quick-config`
4. **Platform-Agnostic**: Not bound to any specific MCP vendor; auto-detects at runtime
5. **Methodology Self-Contained**: Core analysis engine has built-in methodology; not dependent on external resources
6. **Traceable**: Four-tier source traceability label system; citation reliability is transparent

---

## Methodological Foundation

The plugin's core analysis engine (Element Attack/Defense Analysis) employs the following methodological framework:

- **Claim-Basis Method (Anspruchsgrundlage)**: Reverse-searches normative basis from the legal effect of claims, reviews element-by-element
- **Court-Report Technique (Relationstechnik)**: Plaintiff phase → Defendant phase → Counter-defense → Re-counter-defense → Evidence phase, progressive review
- **Three-Layer Review Structure**: Right has arisen → Right has not been extinguished → Right is exercisable; progressive layers where negation at any layer negates the whole
